Full exercise
Using ROOT make following steps in order to make a likelihood methods study for datasets "Exercise_Likelihood_n" containing simulations of signals+background
    A) Plot and fit histograms using various models for background signal  
    B) Do a likelihood scan of "S" and "B" parameters (counting for signal and background)
    C) Do a profile likelihood scan of the "S" Parameter
